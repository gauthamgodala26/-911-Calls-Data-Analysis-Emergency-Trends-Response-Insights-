# -911-Calls-Data-Analysis-Emergency-Trends-Response-Insights-

----
Description:

This project dives into 911 emergency call data to uncover critical insights into emergency trends, response times, and call distributions using Python. By analyzing real-world emergency call records, this project helps in identifying:

âœ… Peak Emergency Hours â€“ When do most 911 calls occur?

âœ… Call Type Distribution â€“ Breakdown of emergency calls (Fire, Traffic, EMS).

âœ… Geospatial Analysis â€“ Mapping call locations to spot high-risk areas.

âœ… Seasonal Trends â€“ How do emergencies vary by time of year?

With data visualization, time-series analysis, and geospatial mapping, this project provides valuable intelligence for emergency response teams, city planners, and policy makers.
